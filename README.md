CI/CD Pipeline for MERN Application
This repository contains a Jenkins pipeline configuration designed to automate the Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) process for a MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) application. This document outlines the pipeline stages and their purposes.

Overview
The CI/CD pipeline automates the following tasks:

Checkout Code: Retrieves the latest code from the specified GitHub repository.

Install Dependencies: Ensures that all necessary Node.js packages are installed for both the frontend and backend.

Static Code Analysis: Uses SonarQube to analyze the code quality and identify potential issues.

Dependency Scanning: Employs OWASP Dependency Check to scan for known vulnerabilities in project dependencies.

Build Docker Images: Builds Docker images for both the frontend and backend applications.

Vulnerability Scanning: Uses Trivy to scan Docker images for vulnerabilities.

Push Docker Images: Publishes the built Docker images to Docker Hub.

Update Kubernetes Deployment Files: Updates Kubernetes deployment YAML files with the new image tags.

Push Changes to GitHub: Commits and pushes the updated deployment files back to the GitHub repository.

Pipeline Stages
1. Git Checkout
Description: Clones the specified branch from the GitHub repository.

2. Install Dependencies
Description: Installs Node.js dependencies for the frontend and backend applications.

3. SonarQube Analysis
Description: Performs static code analysis to identify code quality issues.

4. OWASP Dependency Check
Description: Scans the project for known vulnerabilities in dependencies.

5. Build Docker Images
Description: Builds Docker images for the frontend and backend applications.

6. Trivy Scanning
Description: Scans the Docker images for vulnerabilities.

7. Push Docker Images
Description: Logs in to Docker Hub and pushes the Docker images.

8. Update Deployment YAML Files
Description: Updates Kubernetes deployment files with the new image tags.

9. Push Changes to GitHub
Description: Commits the updated deployment YAML files back to the GitHub repository.

Conclusion
This Jenkins pipeline ensures that your MERN application is continuously integrated and deployed, maintaining high code quality and security standards. Each stage plays a crucial role in automating the build, analysis, and deployment processes.
